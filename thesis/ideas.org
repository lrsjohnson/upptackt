#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
* Overview
** Visualizing "In the Mind's Eye"


* Prior Work

* Imperative Geometry Construction System
** Basic Structures
*** Points
*** Segments, Lines, Rays
*** Angles
    - Initially three points, now vertext + two direction
    - CCW orientation
    - Methods to determine from elements
    - "Arms" of an angle: "Directions"
    - [Future:] Possibly automatically extract angles from diagrams
      (e.g. from a pile of points and segments)
*** Circles, Arcs
*** Math Support (Directions, Vectors)

** Construction Operations
*** Traditional
*** Measurement-based
*** Transformations

** Randomness
*** Remembering choices
*** Avoiding Almost-degenerate points
*** Animating

** Dependencies
*** Naming
*** Dependencies
*** Forcing higher-level random dependencies

** Construction Language
*** Macros
*** Multiple Assignment

** Analysis
*** What is Interesting
*** Removing obvious properties

* Declarative Geometry Constraint Solver
** Mechanical Analogies
*** Bars, Joint Linkages
*** Mechanism
*** Propagators

** Partial Information
*** Regions
*** Direction Intervals

** Propagator Constraints
*** Basic Constraints for Bar, Joint
*** Higher-level constraints

** Specification Ordering
*** Constraints First

* Learning
