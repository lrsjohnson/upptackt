\section{Overview}

The Learning and learning module is one the core elements integrating
information from the other components of the system. It maintains

\section{Interactions with Learning Module}

\subsection{Querying}

\begin{verbatim}
(what-is 'parallelogram')
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Learning Definitions}

\begin{verbatim}
(learn-term 'parallelogram random-parallelogram)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Applying Learned Properties}

\begin{verbatim}
(analyze-figure figure-proc)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Representing Discoveries}

For example, assertions about equality of segments |AB| = |CD| are
independent of the ordering of points within the elements.

\subsection{Pattern Matching against existing conjectures}

Based on dependencies, we replace the lowest-level random dependencies
with arbitrary pattern elements \texttt{(? s1 ,segment)} for
instance. Then, when new conjectures are being considered, we attempt
to pattern match based on existing elements to see if there is a
redundant observation.
