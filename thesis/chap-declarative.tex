\chapter{Declarative Geometry Constraint Solver}
\label{chap:declarative}

\section{Overview}

The third module is a declarative geometric constraint solver. Given a
user-specified topology of a diagram and various constraints on
segments and angles, this module solves the specification and if
possible, instantiates a figure that satisfies the constraints.

The solver is implemented using propagators, uses new types of partial
information about point regions and direction intervals, and focuses
on emulating the mental process of wiggling constrained figures in the
mind's eye. The physical nature of this process is captured by forming
analogies between geometry diagrams and mechanical linkages of bars
and joints.

After providing a brief overview of the mechanical analogies and quick
background on the propagator system, I examine an example of the
system solving a set of constraints for an under-constrained
rectangle. Then, I describe the module implementation, starting with
the new partial information representations and linkage constraints
before explaining how mechanisms are assembled and solved. Finally,
some limitations and extensions are discussed.

\section{Mechanical Analogies}

The geometry constraint solver - physical manipulation, simulation,
and ``wiggling''.

\section{Example}
\begin{code-example}{Rectangle Constraints Example}{images/rect-demo-2.png}
(define (is-this-a-rectangle-2)
  (m:mechanism
   (m:establish-polygon-topology 'a 'b 'c 'd)
   (m:c-length-equal (m:bar 'a 'd)
                     (m:bar 'b 'c))
   (m:c-right-angle (m:joint 'd))
   (m:c-angle-equal (m:joint 'a)
                    (m:joint 'c))))
\end{code-example}

\subsection{Bar and Joint Linkages}

Bars have endpoints, directions and length. Joints have a vertex point
and two directions. Currently, most joints are directioned and have
max value of 180 degrees.

\subsection{Mechanism}

The Mechanism in our declarative system is analogous to Figure,
grouping elements. Also computes various caching and lookup tables to
more easily access elements.

\begin{code-listing}
(define (m:build-mechanism m)
  (m:identify-vertices m)
  (m:assemble-linkages (m:mechanism-bars m)
                       (m:mechanism-joints m))
  (m:apply-mechanism-constraints m)
  (m:apply-slices m))

(define (m:solve-mechanism m)
  (m:initialize-solve)
  (let lp ()
    (run)
    (cond ((m:mechanism-contradictory? m)
           (m:draw-mechanism m c)
           #f)
          ((not (m:mechanism-fully-specified? m))
           (if (m:specify-something m)
               (lp)
               (error "Couldn't find anything to specify.")))
          (else 'mechanism-built))))
\end{code-listing}

\section{Partial Information}

\subsection{Regions}

Propagating partial information across bars and joints yields a new
region system: Regions include point sets of one or more possible
points, an entire ray, or an entire arc. These rays and arcs are
from an anchored bar with only one of direction or length specified,
for instance.

\subsection{Direction Intervals}

Ranges of intervals. Full circle + invalid intervals. Adding and
subtracting intervals of direction and thetas gets complicated at times.

Challenges with intersection, multiple segments. Eventually just
return nothing is okay.

\section{Propagator Constraints}

System uses propagators to solve these mechanism constraints.

\subsection{Basic Linkage Constraints}

Direction, dx, dy, length, thetas. ``Bars'' + ``Joints''

\begin{code-listing}{Basic Bar Constraints}
(define (m:make-bar bar-id)
  (let ((bar-key (m:make-bar-name-key bar-id)))
    (let ((p1 (m:make-point (symbol bar-key '-p1)))
          (p2 (m:make-point (symbol bar-key '-p2))))
      (name! p1 (symbol bar-key '-p1))
      (name! p2 (symbol bar-key '-p2))
      (let ((v (m:make-vec bar-key)))
        (c:+ (m:point-x p1)
             (m:vec-dx v)
             (m:point-x p2))
        (c:+ (m:point-y p1)
             (m:vec-dy v)
             (m:point-y p2))
        (let ((bar (%m:make-bar p1 p2 v)))
          (m:p1->p2-bar-propagator p1 p2 bar)
          (m:p2->p1-bar-propagator p2 p1 bar)
          bar)))))
\end{code-listing}

\subsection{Higher Order Constraints}

\begin{code-listing}{User Constraints}
(define-record-type <m:constraint>
  (m:make-constraint type args constraint-procedure)
  m:constraint?
  (type m:constraint-type)
  (args m:constraint-args)
  (constraint-procedure m:constraint-procedure))

(define (m:c-length-equal bar-id-1 bar-id-2)
  (m:make-constraint
   'm:c-length-equal
   (list bar-id-1 bar-id-2)
   (lambda (m)
     (let ((bar-1 (m:lookup m bar-id-1))
           (bar-2 (m:lookup m bar-id-2)))
       (c:id
        (m:bar-length bar-1)
        (m:bar-length bar-2))))))
\end{code-listing}

Angle sum of polygon, or scan through polygon and ensure that the
angles don't not match. Example is equilateral triangle, for
instance... Could also observe always ``60 degrees'' as an interesting
fact and put that in as a constraint. They're alebgraically quite
similar, but my propagators currently don't perform symbolic algebra.

\section{Solving: Specification Ordering}

Given a wired diagram, process is repeatedly specifying values for elements

\subsection{Anchored vs. Specified vs. Initialized}

\section{Backtracking}

If it can't build a figure with a given set of specifications, it will
first try some neighboring values, then backtrack and try a new value
for the previous element. After a number of failed attempts, it will
abort and claim that at this time, it is unable to build a diagram
satisfying the constraints.

(This doesn't mean that it is impossible: Add analysis/info about what
it can/can't solve)

\section{Interfacing with existing diagrams}

Converts between figures and symbolic relationships.

\section{Specification Interface}

\subsubsection{Establish Polygon Topology}

Nice techniques for establishing polygon topology.

\begin{code-listing}{Establishing Topology}
(define (m:establish-polygon-topology . point-names)
  (if (< (length point-names) 3)
      (error "Min polygon size: 3"))
  (let ((extended-point-names
         (append point-names
                 (list (car point-names) (cadr point-names)))))
    (let ((bars
           (map (lambda (p1-name p2-name)
                  (m:make-named-bar p1-name p2-name))
                point-names
                (cdr extended-point-names)))
          (joints
           (map (lambda (p1-name vertex-name p2-name)
                  (m:make-named-joint p1-name vertex-name p2-name))
                (cddr extended-point-names)
                (cdr extended-point-names)
                point-names)))
      (append bars joints
              (list (m:polygon-sum-slice
                     (map m:joint-name joints)))))))
\end{code-listing}

\section{Extensions}

Future efforts involve an improved backtrack-search mechanism if
constraints fail, and a system of initializing the diagram with
content from an existing figure, kicking out and wiggling arbitrary
premises, and seeing how the resulting diagram properties respond.
