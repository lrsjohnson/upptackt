In this thesis, I created and analyzed an interactive computer system
capable of exploring geometry concepts through inductive
investigation.  My system begins with a limited set of knowledge about
basic geometry and enables a user interacting with the system to
``teach'' the system additional geometry concepts and theorems by
suggesting investigations the system should explore to see if it
``notices anything interesting.''  The system uses probabilistic
sampling and physical simulations to emulate the more human-like
processes of manipulating diagrams ``in the mind's eye.'' It then uses
symbolic pattern matching and a propagator-based truth maintenance
system to appropriately generalize findings and propose newly
discovered theorems. These theorems can be rigorously proved using
external proof assistants, but also be used by the system to assist in
its explorations of new, higher-level concepts. Through a series of
simple investigations similar to an introductory course in geometry,
the system has been able to propose and learn a few dozen standard
geometry theorems, and through more self-directed explorations, it has
discovered several interesting properties and theorems not typically
covered in standard mathematics courses.
