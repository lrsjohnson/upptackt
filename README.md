MIT M.Eng: Automated Elementary Geometry Theorem Discovery via Inductive Diagram Manipulation

In this thesis, I created and analyzed an interactive computer system
capable of exploring geometry concepts through inductive
investigation.  My system begins with a limited set of knowledge about
basic geometry and enables a user interacting with the system to
"teach" the system additional geometry concepts and theorems by
suggesting investigations the system should explore to see if it
"notices anything interesting."  The system uses random sampling and
physical simulations to emulate the more human-like processes of
manipulating diagrams ``in the mind's eye.'' It then uses symbolic
pattern matching and a propagator-based truth maintenance system to
appropriately generalize findings and propose newly discovered
theorems. These theorems can be rigorously proved using external proof
assistants, but also be used by the system to assist in its
explorations of new, higher-level concepts. Through a series of simple
investigations similar to an introductory course in geometry, the
system has been able to propose and learn a few dozen standard
geometry theorems, and through more self-directed explorations, it has
discovered several interesting properties and theorems not typically
covered in standard mathematics courses.
